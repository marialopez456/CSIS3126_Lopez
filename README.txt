Introducting TikcoTech!
TIkcoTech is a spanish website that focus on giving the latino community access to useful articles about technology such as how to install windows 11 and find out new hacks about their phones. This is a community based website that means anyone can write, edit and delete articles so they can share their knowledge to everyone!

Problem statement: 
There is a big interest in learning new things about your phone or an app in the Latinx community. Such as, how to add a live wallpaper to your background or how to lock a certain app on your phone. While there are many websites for technology in English, there aren’t many in Spanish. So, my project idea is to create a website that contains various articles about things you don’t know your phone or app
 can do.  

HOW TO USE TIKCOTECH:


Download node.js on your computer
Install express.js in the terminal enter npm install express
Install passport: npm install passport
Download mongodb (mongodb.com) Create database called nodekb and create a collection called articles
Install mongoose: npm install mongoose
Install bcrypt npm install bcrypt
 Once you install everything you need to run TikcoTech. Download the zip file of the code from github. Once downloaded go to the terminal and type cd directory/CSIS3126_Lopez. I added my folder to my documents so mine looked like this: cd C:\Users\umalo\OneDrive\Documents\CSIS3126_Lopez\CSIS3126_Lopez
Then in the terminal enter npm run devStart
To access tikcotech on your browser, enter http://localhost:3000/
it should automatically direct you to the login page where you should create an account and login in.
